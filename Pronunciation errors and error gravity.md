# Pronunciation errors and error gravity
My Husband and Osamu

## Introduction
+ Why errors occur
+ Whether or not they can be predicted in advance
+ How they should be ranked in terms of their gravity
+ What they tell us about the phonetic acquisition process

## What counts as an error

## Classifying learners' errors 


### Segmental errors 
+ Table 4.1. Classification of L2 segmental errors 
 1.	Insertion 
 2.	Deletion 
 3.	Substitution 
 4.	Distortion 

### Prosodic errors 
1. Stress
2. Intonation
3. Rhythm

### Other problems
1. Fluency 
2. Speaking rate
3. Voice quality 
4. Other non-linguistic and paralinguistic aspects of L2 speech 


## Explaining why pronunciation errors occur 

### Contrastive analysis 
+ CAH
