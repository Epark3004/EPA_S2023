###Study Aim and Research Questions###
〮Few studies have systematically examined how rhythm is displayed by L2 learners at different proficiency levels and from controlled L1 backgrounds, and even fewer studies to date have employed the rhythm metrics used here in the context of learner speech at different proficiency levels. 

〮The aim of this study, therefore, is to offer a more comprehensive empirically based investigation of rhythm in L2 speech than that given in previous studies in order to establish to what extent rhythmic measures can discriminate between proficiency levels.
