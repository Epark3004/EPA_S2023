##Methodology
Speech samples 
speaking test 
20 English learners 
3 typologically different L1 backgrounds 
six CEFR levels(A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2). 
Approximately 60 seconds of speech - Question-and-Answer task - extemporaneous speech
1.	CEFR Levels A2–C2 - Cambridge English face-to-face speaking tests / Level A1 - a computerdelivered speaking test: to minimize method effects
2.	using Fair Average marks generated by Facets (Linacre, 1989): to minimize rater effects
〮The three languages were chosen to be typologically different: German is stress-timed (Kohler, 1982); Spanish is syllable-timed (Pike, 1945); whereas Korean is generally considered to be neither stress-timed nor syllable-timed (Seong, 1995). CEFR Levels B1 and B2 formed the basis of Study 2.

Speech measures 
The 20 speech samples were analyzed for a number of measures which quantify different aspects of speech rhythm, and which were chosen based on previous research linking these measures to proficiency level or L1 differences. 
Table 9.3 provides a definition of these measures and their operationalization. Taken together, an analysis of learner speech across a range of proficiency levels using these measures should reveal how successful learners are at each level in producing speech that has stress-timing features.

Analysis
1.	Praat : Syllable durations and durations of consonantal and vocalic intervals
2.	Labelling : Figure 9.2. unaccented and non-final (labelled as ‘s’), accented (‘sa’), final (‘sef’), accented and final (‘safe’) or hesitated (‘sx’). 
3.	To ensure consistency : Maximum Onset Principle (Pulgram, 1970)
4.	The second tier was also used to calculate speech rate by counting the number of syllables that were realized in each 60-second speech sample. 
5.	The third and fourth tier together provided the information required for the calculation of the rhythm metrics. In the third tier, each vowel and consonant was segmented primarily by visual inspection of the speech waveforms and wideband spectrograms with reference to standard criteria (e.g. Peterson & Lehiste, 1960; White & Mattys, 2007). The fourth tier contains the phrasing information, that is, the beginning and end of an intonation phrase. 
6.	Inter-coder agreement was measured for a subset (15%) of the data (one speaker per language). The inter-coder agreement was 97% (calculated as number of codes of agreement/total number of codes). 
7.	Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 20 : multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with factors - Language background (Spanish, German, Korean) and Proficiency level (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2), and fixed factors Rhythm metrics (nPVI-V, Varco-V, Varco-C, %V, rPVI-C, nPVI-C).
- nPVI-V: normalized pairwise variability index for vocalic intervals
- Varco-V: variability coefficient for vocalic intervals
- Varco-C: variability coefficient for consonantal intervals
- %*: percentage of vocalic intervals
- rPVI-C: raw pairwise variability index for consonantal intervals
- nPVI-C: normalized pairwise variability index for consonantal intervals
Results 
Study 1: Differences across proficiency levels - 12 Spanish learners - six different proficiency 
three (seen in Figure 9.3) were found to be discriminative for CEFR level: 
1.	main effect
%V, F(5, 141) = 2.33, p < 0.05
Varco-C, F(5, 141) = 4.02, p < 0.01
nPVI-C, F(2, 148) = 2.65, p < 0.05
2.	Post hoc tests (Scheffe) 
1)	Varco-C, A1 and A2 (p = 0.078), between A2 and C1 (p < 0.05), and A2 and C2 (p < 0.05)
2)	nPVI-C, A2 and C2 (p < 0.05)
3)	%V none of the individual comparisons reached significance.
